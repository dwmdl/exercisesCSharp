# Solutions of different tasks in C# language
Here I publish a tasks I completed while studying the C# language

1. The name of the folder indicates the topic to which the tasks in it belong. 
2. The file name partially describes the task (I tried to choose the right ones)
3. A description of the task to be performed can be found in the commit messages. 
   1. If the file contains multiple commits, then the description should be in the very first
4. Finally, each file is my own solution to the task

If you really find these problems interesting, my advice to you is to try to solve everything yourself. All of these tasks are suitable for beginners.
