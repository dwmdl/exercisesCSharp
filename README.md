# Solutions of different tasks in C# language
Here I publish a tasks I completed while studying a particular topic
1. The name of the file corresponds to what is being executed in it
2. In each file, at the very beginning, the task that needed to be done is described in more detail
3. You can only read the description and try to solve it
4. The folder names indicate the complexity level of the tasks. I set the complexity of the tasks myself, depending on how long the solution took
